        <h1>Mapping the Educational Challenges in Rivers State</h1>
        <p>Rivers State, one of Nigeria's most populous regions, faces significant challenges in its educational systems. The map below provides a detailed visualization of hospitals and schools across the state, 
            highlighting the pressing issues they face. From under-resourced educational facilities to insufficient classrooms, 
            the situation requires urgent attention from decision-makers and investors.</p>

        <h2>Educational Challenges: Overcrowded Schools and Poor Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>The schools across Rivers State tell a similar story of inadequacy. Many of the mapped 
            schools suffer from overcrowded classrooms, with insufficient classroom sizes to 
            accommodate the growing number of students. Facilities such as toilets are either inadequate or entirely absent, 
            particularly in rural schools, where children are often forced to attend classes in 
            poorly maintained or even unsafe structures.</p>

        <p>Key services like water availability, sports pitches, and sick bays are frequently lacking, 
            which significantly impacts the students' health, well-being, and overall learning experience.

    <!-- How the Map Can Help -->
    <section id="how-map-helps">
        <h2>The Importance of Data for Decision-Makers and Investors</h2>
        <p>This map provides not just a geographical overview but a comprehensive insight into the systemic 
            issues faced by Secondary schools in Rivers State. The data collected and visualized here serves 
            as an invaluable tool for:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Decision-Makers: Government officials and policy-makers can use this data to identify 
                    critical areas that require immediate intervention. For example, the map highlights regions
                     where education services are most underdeveloped, allowing for targeted resource allocation to 
                     improve the education outcomes of underserved Local Government Areas.</li>
                     <li>Investors: This data offers investors a clear view of where their capital can make the most significant impact. Healthcare and education sectors are crucial drivers of development, and this map serves as a roadmap for potential investors looking to address critical infrastructure gaps. By investing in these sectors, they 
                        can not only generate financial returns but also create 
                        lasting social impact, improving the quality of life for millions of people.</li>
                        <li>Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): NGOs focused on education or community 
                            development can utilize this data to plan effective interventions.
                             By understanding where the gaps are, they can direct their efforts to the regions that need them the most.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This Data Can Help:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Identifying Priorities: The data helps decision-makers prioritize investments and 
                    reforms based on regions most in need, whether it be in healthcare or education. For example, rural hospitals that lack water supply can be prioritized for infrastructure development, 
                    while schools without sports facilities can receive 
                    targeted interventions to promote students' physical health and wellness.</li>
                    <li>Informed Investments: Investors can use the map to identify regions where infrastructure development
                         will have the most significant impact,
                         whether in upgrading healthcare facilities, building new schools, or improving existing educational resources.</li>
                         <li>Tracking Progress: As improvements are made, this map can 
                            serve as a baseline for tracking the progress of interventions.
                             Policymakers and investors can use it to monitor changes over time and assess whether their investments 
                             are delivering the intended benefits to local communities.
                         </li>
              </ul>

        <h2>Update On The GridCode Challenge</h2>
        <p>Team Splendor couldn't participate in the challenge as the link in the API documentation earlier sent was not found, We sent email, though there was no direct 
            response, but the team noticed that the site came up by monday being 18th, November. <br/>
            The team tried to integrate the gridcode API in the map but we kept getting an error message that says 'API Key is expired'
            <br/>
            We hoped to have participate in the challenge to see the uniqueness it would have added to our map.
